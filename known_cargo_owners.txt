# This file helps identify dependencies owned by known
# and reputable authors.
#
# List usernames of crates.io users line by line to
# make them count as "known owners" in `crev verify`
# output.
#
# Remember that `crev` has no way to verify information
# returned by crates.io, or if the crate was in fact
# published by their real owners. This feature is only
# meant to help identify crates that should be reviewed
# and verified first, and might be removed in the future.
