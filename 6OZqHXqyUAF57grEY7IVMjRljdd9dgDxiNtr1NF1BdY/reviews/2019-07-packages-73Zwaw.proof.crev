comment: "Read all of src, skimmed all of tests.  core_lazy.rs looks a little odd, but is 100% safe code - any issues would be in it's core dependency, spin.  inline_lazy.rs contains unsafe blocks... look safe, but downgrades rating to merely positive.  lib.rs is just safe macros.  Tests all pass."

comment: "Interesting idea.  Lots of unsafe!  Supposedly auto-generated.\nI have at least read the code enough (including explicitly looking at each use of unsafe)\nto believe there are no obvious funny business nor proper soundness issues.  That said:\n\nConcerns (rating: neutral):\n  Lots of concerning use of unsafe { ... } + core::mem::uninitialized()... but only in #[test] code.\n  #[allow(improper_ctypes)] for extern \"C\" block.  Sounds like UB-bait.\n  Punts all safety concerns to the user.\n\nConcerns (thoroughness: low):\n  I have not properly vetted fn/struct/type signatures against a proper reference.\n"

  lazy_static 0.2.11 relied on unsafe muts which would have race conditions during initialization.
  I recommend upgrading to a modern lazy_static 1.3.0+!
  
  src\core_lazy.rs:       +1
  src\lazy.rs:            -1 UNSOUND (race conditions in multithreaded init due to static mut / mut refs taken outside of call_once)
  src\lib.rs:             -1 UNSOUND (uses the static muts without syncronization)
  src\nightly_lazy.rs:    -1 UNSOUND (race conditions in multithreaded init due to static mut / mut refs taken outside of call_once)
  
  tests\*:                +1 (skimmed, seem fine)

  I believe this is sound, but has way too much unsafe and too few tests for my tastes.
  udivmod_1e19 reduces my thoroughness and understanding to low, otherwise both would be medium or higher.

  thoroughness: low - mostly due to iOS FFI, shell stuff not being super thorough, and review fatigue causing my eyes to glaze over in places.
  understanding: low - lots of shell/path stuff that I don't know well enough to verify
  rating: neutral - see concerns bellow.
  
  
  
  Concerns
  ========
  - Looks like lots of stuff might not work on windows... although there *is* windows-specific code, so maybe?
  - Lots of unimplemented!()
  - iOS support is chock full of unsafe { ... } for FFI.  I haven't verified the FFI signatures.
  - iOS support also uses unsafe { ... } for several objective C casts.  Needs some sanity checked utility functions.
  - iOS support has some potential UB during panics due to unwinding over FFI boundaries.
  - Implements some code signing stuff for iOS.  Necessary, and just your local certs, but I haven't fully reasoned through what security impacts if any that has.
  - Few unit tests visible in the crate itself (maybe they're separate and unpackaged?)
  - Sandboxing concerns
      - Remotes into other devices, including over ssh.
      - Frequent use of shell commands could lead to build server RCEs given malicious project metadata
      - Malicious projects will just use a build.rs file though, front door is open so to speak.

  foreign_type! can generate unsound code without using the `unsafe` keyword in client code at all.
  
  - Invokes C FFI which may be unsafe from safe fns.
  - More recent versions (0.4.0) can implement unsafe traits (Send, Sync) without the unsafe keyword at all.

  Prefer 0.4.11 which at least starts using MaybeUninit instead of uninitialized!(), which is fundamentally unsound.
  Uses a disturbing amount of unsafe, but aside from uninitialized, it all at least appears to be correct after a careful reading.
  Unlike smallvec, this doesn't fall back on the heap.
  Better than whatever you'll write rolling your own, at least.

  | 56    | unsafe - new_array ~ uninitialized, Array is an unsafe trait though so only implement it if this is sound...?
  | 95    | No CapacityError?  Inconsistent vs from...
  | 160   | unsafe { ... } - looks correct
  | 213   | unsafe { ... } - looks correct
  | 216   | could be a slice copy instead

  | 318   | unsafe { ... } - looks correct
  | 331   | unsafe fn - decent docs, looks correct, should be more explicit about uninitialized though
  | 342   | unsafe fn - needs better docs, but looks correct
  | 351   | unsafe { ... } - looks correct
  | 361   | unsafe { ... } - scary transmute, but just from &mut [u8] to &mut str.  stdlib from_utf8_unchecked does equivalent pointer casts

  Prefer 0.4.11 which at least starts using MaybeUninit instead of uninitialized!(), which is fundamentally unsound.
  Uses a disturbing amount of unsafe, but aside from uninitialized, it all at least appears to be correct after a careful reading.
  Unlike smallvec, this doesn't fall back on the heap.
  Better than whatever you'll write rolling your own, at least.
  
  See 0.4.7 for base review.  Diffed 0.4.7 -> 0.4.8, no concerning changes.

  0.4.7 -> 0.4.8: IntoIter implemented Clone, unconcerning
  0.4.8 -> 0.4.9: ArrayString initialized to 0, ArrayVec uses nightly MaybeUninit.  Unfortunately stable still uses uninitialized!() so this is still negative.

  Probably sound as of 0.4.11 on Rust 1.36.0+?
  Uses a disturbing amount of unsafe, but aside from uninitialized! use in ArrayVec 1.35 and earlier, it all at least appears to be correct after a careful reading.
  Unlike smallvec, this doesn't fall back on the heap.
  Better than whatever you'll write rolling your own, at least.
  
  0.4.7  -> 0.4.8:  IntoIter implemented Clone, unconcerning

  0.4.9  -> 0.4.10: #[repr(C)], -Clone for MaybeUninit.  Apparently I missed more possible unsoundness.  Unsafe is hard.
  0.4.10 -> 0.4.11: ArrayVec should now also be sound in Rust 1.36.0+, probably, maybe.

  Looks nice and solid.  Well documented, well tested, code coverage, safe + sound.
  Large crate - so I haven't taken the time to thoroughly audit everything - but I have at least skimmed over all code.
  I've written some of my own partial DWARF parser in C++ in the past... parts look appropriately familiar.

  unsound? https://github.com/tomprogrammer/rust-ascii/issues/65
  
  Lots of repeated unsafe.
  No debug_assert! s for uncheck codepaths.
  Unsound test code assumes gen_range meets it's safe API contract.
  Not fully reviewed.

  UNSOUND: https://github.com/tomprogrammer/rust-ascii/issues/64 (I didn't catch this one)
  unsound? https://github.com/tomprogrammer/rust-ascii/issues/65
  
  Lots of repeated unsafe.
  No debug_assert! s for uncheck codepaths.
  Unsound test code assumes gen_range meets it's safe API contract.
  Not fully reviewed.

  Good solid FFI crate.  Manual generation (I see comments!) concerns me, but upon review it looks to have been done correctly.
  
  Verified all structs and FFI signatures against android JNI.h, with the exception of double checking that *everything* is marked JNICALL on windows JNI instead of just most of it.
  Android JNI lacks parameter names, so I didn't sanity check those either.
  Verified against %LOCALAPPDATA%\Android\Sdk\ndk-bundle\toolchains\llvm\prebuilt\windows-x86_64\sysroot\usr\include\jni.h

  | 7     | +1    | Looks sufficiently correct to me - VS defines this as *mut c_char, but *mut c_void is close enough IMO.
  | 10    | +1    | all verified
  | 20    | 0     | native version uses more newtypes, but without inheritence maybe this is sane in Rust.
  | 39    | +1    | verified
  | 51    | +1    | sure
  | 57    | +1    | |
  | 64    | -1    | DANGER - rust enum for C enum is begging for unsound if returned from FFI
  | 71    | +1    | JNI constants here all look good
  | 93    | 0     | JNINativeMethod - C version uses const char*, but the muts here aren't a *big* deal... I
  | 99    | +1    | |
  | 105   | +1    | JNINativeInterface is bloody huge, but all methods appear to match in name, position, and signature... |
  | 115   |       | ...with the caveat that there's a lot of "system" convention when JNICALL isn't used throughout the android jni.h.  However, it *is* used in openjdk so that's probably fine?
  | 116   |       | I'm also assuming `Option<unsafe extern "system" fn(...) -> ...>` is FFI compatible with C function pointers, which might be a bad assumption. |
  | 157   |       | Native version isn't marked no return but I bet it is.
  | 175   |       | Also, varargs functions degrade to "C" mode per https://stackoverflow.com/a/3615407
  | 1411  |       | Reviewed all the way to here!
  | 1413  | +1    | Sure
  | 1421  | +1    | JNIEnv_ - Lack of impl with forwarding fns like jni.h has is vageuly annoying.

  | 70    | `JavaVM::build` in doc comments, not `new` ?
  | 101   | Pretty gosh darn heckin' sketchy if you ask me... relies on opts never being modified after this point.  Fortunately this type's contents are nice and private/local, so that's enforced.

  ### src/wrapper/java_vm/vm.rs

  | 134   | unsafe impl Send + Sync - I believe this is safe for JavaVM (as used here), but not for JNIEnv (keep a look out for that later)

  ### src/wrapper/objects/jbytebuffer.rs 
  
  | Line | Notes |
  | ----:| ----- |
  | 11    | jobject is just a pointer, so this general purpouse crate-exported method means using JByteBuffer s is unsafe!
  | 32    | there's no guarantee a given JObject is a JByteBuffer, but this succeeds unconditionally.
  |       | -1 - I suspect invalid jobject s will cause soundness issues later

  | Line | Notes |
  | ----:| ----- |
  | 20    | Eww, methods cached per-object?
  | 46    | jobject -> JObject -> JList can be constructed with an invalid pointer...
  | 69    | ...making all safe fns on this type unsound.  Use of 'safe' _unchecked methods also concerns me.

  | 105   | +1    | java_vm_unchecked - 'unchecked' refers to error codes.  unsafe macro, $java_vm must be valid.
  | 132   | -1    | java_vm_method    -  I wish this forced the caller to use `unsafe { ... }`.  unsafe macro, $jnienv must be valid.

  Looks like a solid crate.  A few minor concerns:
  
  * 755 permissions.  Necessary, but bandied about.
  * Unsanitized path names are accessible, easy to misuse.
  * Doesn't ban access to `CON` or similar.
  * Lacks fuzz tests

  | 215   | I'd like this to have a scarier name... but eh, at least it's sound.
  | 250   | This drops invalid components... I think it should return an error on invalid components.  But at least it's sound and shouldn't be vulnerable to path navigation attacks?
  | 250   | This doesn't forbid `CON` or similar.
  | 298   | *Excellent* test, this is exactly what I want to see!

  Solid looking, 100% safe.  Only concern is CI scripts downloading random URLs.
