review:
  thoroughness: high
  understanding: high
  rating: positive
comment: "Read all of src, skimmed all of tests.  core_lazy.rs looks a little odd, but is 100% safe code - any issues would be in it's core dependency, spin.  inline_lazy.rs contains unsafe blocks... look safe, but downgrades rating to merely positive.  lib.rs is just safe macros.  Tests all pass."
