comment: "Read all of src, skimmed all of tests.  core_lazy.rs looks a little odd, but is 100% safe code - any issues would be in it's core dependency, spin.  inline_lazy.rs contains unsafe blocks... look safe, but downgrades rating to merely positive.  lib.rs is just safe macros.  Tests all pass."

comment: "Interesting idea.  Lots of unsafe!  Supposedly auto-generated.\nI have at least read the code enough (including explicitly looking at each use of unsafe)\nto believe there are no obvious funny business nor proper soundness issues.  That said:\n\nConcerns (rating: neutral):\n  Lots of concerning use of unsafe { ... } + core::mem::uninitialized()... but only in #[test] code.\n  #[allow(improper_ctypes)] for extern \"C\" block.  Sounds like UB-bait.\n  Punts all safety concerns to the user.\n\nConcerns (thoroughness: low):\n  I have not properly vetted fn/struct/type signatures against a proper reference.\n"

  lazy_static 0.2.11 relied on unsafe muts which would have race conditions during initialization.
  I recommend upgrading to a modern lazy_static 1.3.0+!
  
  src\core_lazy.rs:       +1
  src\lazy.rs:            -1 UNSOUND (race conditions in multithreaded init due to static mut / mut refs taken outside of call_once)
  src\lib.rs:             -1 UNSOUND (uses the static muts without syncronization)
  src\nightly_lazy.rs:    -1 UNSOUND (race conditions in multithreaded init due to static mut / mut refs taken outside of call_once)
  
  tests\*:                +1 (skimmed, seem fine)

  I believe this is sound, but has way too much unsafe and too few tests for my tastes.
  udivmod_1e19 reduces my thoroughness and understanding to low, otherwise both would be medium or higher.

  thoroughness: low - mostly due to iOS FFI, shell stuff not being super thorough, and review fatigue causing my eyes to glaze over in places.
  understanding: low - lots of shell/path stuff that I don't know well enough to verify
  rating: neutral - see concerns bellow.
  
  
  
  Concerns
  ========
  - Looks like lots of stuff might not work on windows... although there *is* windows-specific code, so maybe?
  - Lots of unimplemented!()
  - iOS support is chock full of unsafe { ... } for FFI.  I haven't verified the FFI signatures.
  - iOS support also uses unsafe { ... } for several objective C casts.  Needs some sanity checked utility functions.
  - iOS support has some potential UB during panics due to unwinding over FFI boundaries.
  - Implements some code signing stuff for iOS.  Necessary, and just your local certs, but I haven't fully reasoned through what security impacts if any that has.
  - Few unit tests visible in the crate itself (maybe they're separate and unpackaged?)
  - Sandboxing concerns
      - Remotes into other devices, including over ssh.
      - Frequent use of shell commands could lead to build server RCEs given malicious project metadata
      - Malicious projects will just use a build.rs file though, front door is open so to speak.

      50  Not sure if the underlying iOS APIs are thread safe, but this seems acceptable.
      277 unsafe { ... } for FFI.  Looks generally safe except for scary mem::transmute(kCFBooleanTrue), but even that may be right.

      Various minor const differences, a few functions missing in ref, a few likely improved definitions in places.

      62  UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR:  Possible panic unwind through FFI, technically an hazard.
          I would've missed this edge case but for the comment, so I'm not docking points.

  foreign_type! can generate unsound code without using the `unsafe` keyword in client code at all.
  
  - Invokes C FFI which may be unsafe from safe fns.
  - More recent versions (0.4.0) can implement unsafe traits (Send, Sync) without the unsafe keyword at all.

  Looks great overall.
  I haven't double-checked any logic against WASM specs.
  I haven't verified that WASM validation is suitable to rely upon for JIT compilers or the like.
