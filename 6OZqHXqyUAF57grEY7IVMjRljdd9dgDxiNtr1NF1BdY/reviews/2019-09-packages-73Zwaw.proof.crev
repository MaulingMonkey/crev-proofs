  Good starting point, and my favorite Rust MIDI API so far, but likely unsound as stands.
  
  Pros:
    - Pure rust, no mucking with building building C/C++ libs like with portmidi
    - To be WASM/Browser compatible (PR made).
  
  Cons:
    - Likely unsound as currently stands (transmute_copy, type punning, sketchy memalloc crate use, haven't vetted thread safety properly, ...)
    - API clunky in spots (mix of known issues and easily fixed surface level stuff)
    - Needs more unit test coverage if possible (are there perhaps virtual MIDI devices for windows that could be added to CI...?)
  
  TODO:
    - rating: netural: Eliminate as much sketchy unsafe as possible.
    - rating: positive: Clean up API design a bit (async, saner member functions, deal with Send inconsistency, maybe make connecting not consume MidiInput s?)

  Do not use on User Generated Content!
      * Vulnerable to path traversal attacks if fed bogus .tmx files (see Tileset::new_reference)
      * No obvious protection against zipbombs
      * A couple cases where bad input will panic, a potential DoS vector.
  
  For game engines, there's also no great way to inject your own virtual filesystem callbacks (again see Tileset::new_reference)
  
  There's also a few missing features:
      * Wang Tiles
      * Terrains
      * "file" Custom Properties

  |  28 | get_attrs!              | Eep
  |  53 | parse_tag!              | Mishandles nested tags... fortunately that's probably not necessary.
  |  97 | Colour::from_str        | British... and a possible source of panics.
  | 161 | PropertyValue::new      | No "file" support (see https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/custom-properties/#adding-properties)
  | 238 | Map::new                | My kingdom for some variable names!
  | 256 | Map::new                | Still using try!
  | 385 | Tileset::new_reference  | Possible path traversal attacks, limits ability to inject your own virtual filesystem.
  | 860 | decode_csv              | I've heard decoding arbitrary CSV is way more complicated than this... but this probably works for tile data as used in tmx files.
  | 883 | convert_to_u32          | Kinda want this to be based on iterators to avoid an extra alloc...
