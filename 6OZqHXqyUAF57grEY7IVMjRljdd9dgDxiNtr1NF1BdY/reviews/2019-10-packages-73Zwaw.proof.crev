  std::time::Instant alternative that doesn't panic on wasm targets.
  
  Pros:
  - Doesn't panic!
  - Just std::time::Instant on native, no performance hit or anything
  
  Cons:
  - Just std::time::Instant on native, easy to accidentally use new std APIs unavailable on wasm
  - f64 repr for Instant makes me nervous
  - Unusual license choice for rust projects
  - Could use more test coverage

  | tests/wasm.rs                                 |  0 | test_instant_now could spuriously fail if elapsed() == 0, would like to see more test coverage
